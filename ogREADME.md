## 🌼 About Us

Hey there! We’re **PCSS Pullers** — a student club that loves combining creativity and tech.  
We build things, solve problems, and make every project fun (and sometimes a little chaotic 😅).

Our goal is to **pull** together cool ideas and make them happen — kind of like tractors, but with teamwork and imagination instead of engines.

## 💬 What We Do

> “Teamwork makes the dream work — especially when we add snacks.” 🍪

We work on fun tech projects, coding challenges, and small builds.

Some of the things we love doing:
- 💻 Building small games and programs  
- 🎨 Designing fun graphics or presentations
